    <p>To my belief, making my berry waffles are very fulfilling and a <strong>very</strong> flavourful delight. There're not that many ingredients to make this wonderful meal and quite easy to make.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ol>
      <li> 1 cup frozen berries</li>
      <li> 1/8 cup sugar</li>
      <li> 1/2 cup Welch's black cherry grape juice</li>
      <li> 4 Eggo frozen waffles</li>

    <p>First, we are going to cook the frozen berries. Grab a pot and put your 1 cup of frozen berries in the pot. Then, add your 1/8 cup sugar and add your 1/2 cup of Welch's black cherry grape juice.</p>
    <p>Once you add all that in, put berry mixure on stovetop and set it to a medium tempurature (6 or 5) and let it cook for 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>After it has been 10 minutes separate the berries from the sauce and let the sauce simmer for 25 minutes.</p>
    <p>While you are waiting, you can put the waffles in a toaster and set it to 4.</p>
    <p>Grab a 1/3 of butter and melt it in the microwave for about 25 seconds. Then, put the melted butter on the waffles when the waffles are finish</p>
    <p>Finally, once the sauce of the berries is done, put the berries and the sauce back together again and put the berry mixure on the waffles</p>
    <p>This is optional but, you can add the condensed milk on top of your waffles</p>
